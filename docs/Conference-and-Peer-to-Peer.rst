General Steps How to Create Own WebRTC Conference Room and Peer to Peer Communication
---------------------------
This guide describes How to Create Own WebRTC Conference Room and Peer to Peer Communication with Ant Media Server. This guide you can use WebRTC solutions in different communication formations. In addition to peer-to-peer (1-1) and publish-play (1-N) communication types, you can also implement a WebRTC conference (N-N) solution with Ant Media Server Javascript SDK. Letâ€™s have a look at that step by step. 

How to Create Own WebRTC Conference Room
--------------------------------

At the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to create basic WebRTC Conference Room. This tutorial scope is basics in WebRTC Conference Room. For the detailed technical information follow this `link <https://antmedia.io/how-to-create-a-webrtc-conference-room/>`_.

You need some requirements in build Conference Room. Requirements in listed in below.

.. tip::
	Requeirements:

	Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition

	SSL for both of Website & Ant Media Server

Firstly, you need Ant Media Server Enterprise Edition in this solution. Also, you need SSL in your Website & Ant Media Server. Because of Google Chrome Security rules. If you haven't got any domain for your Ant Media Server, you can get a free domain in Freenom.

If everything is OK, then we skip to the next step.

Prepare the HTML Page 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this section you need some CSS & JS in HTML pages.

	<script src="https://webrtc.github.io/adapter/adapter-latest.js"></script>
	<script src="https://github.com/ant-media/StreamApp/blob/master/src/main/webapp/js/webrtc_adaptor.js"></script> 
	...
	</head>

Include Codes to your page in the body as follows.

.. code-block:: java

	<body>
	...
	<div class="jumbotron">
	<div id="players">
	<div class="col-sm-3">
	<video id="localVideo" autoplay muted></video>
	</div>
	</div>

	<div class="row">
	<div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
	<p>
	<input type="text" class="form-control" value="room1" id="roomName" placeholder="Type room name">
	</p>
	<p>
	<button onclick="joinRoom()" class="btn btn-info" disabled id="join_publish_button">Join Room</button>
	<button onclick="leaveRoom()" class="btn btn-info" disabled id="stop_publish_button">Leave Room</button>
	</p>

	<span class="label label-success" id="broadcastingInfo"
	style="font-size: 14px; display: none" style="display: none">Publishing</span>
	</div>
	</div>
	...
	</body>


Include Codes to your page in the script as follows.

.. code-block:: java

	<script>
	...
	Define Media source variable, SDP variable and etc. 

	Define websocketURL your URL.
	var websocketURL = "wss://domain-name.com:5443/WebRTCAppEE/websocket";

	var webRTCAdaptor = new WebRTCAdaptor(

	}
	...
	</script>


You can analyze and follow the `Conference Example <https://github.com/ant-media/StreamApp/blob/master/src/main/webapp/conference.html>`_ in the Github also.

We hope this tutorial will give an idea about WebRTC conference applications. You can analyze the example at the `Test Server <https://test.antmedia.io:5443/WebRTCAppEE/conference.html>`_. If you have a question, please let us know through contact@antmedia.io
